# Chemistry-Solubility-Groups
Simple project to classify samples according to its behavior in different solutions.
I made this little project while studying Organic Chemistry. Instead of studying chemistry I decide to learn a little about python. Fast forward a couple of months later, I started Henry Full Stack Web Development bootcamp.
